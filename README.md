# CourierKata
Created the logic for courier service using c#, .NET core 3.1.
Done a separate check in for each new feature listed in the requirement.
For courier cost calculation, there is separate code library.
Unit test has been written to cover logic in Cost Calculator Library

Future Improvement: This application is to represent the basic logic for couier cost calcutions. To improve performance, I would use database table 
for cost and Parcel size so it will be easier to amend values in future( currently hard coded to keep application light and show basic logic).
UI can also be represted as a typescript form to get parcel details input and list the prices and discounts in user friendly manner.
